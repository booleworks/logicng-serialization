# LogicNG Serialization Library

A small library which allows for the serialization of LogicNG datastructures like formulas or whole SAT solvers
as Google Protocol buffers.

This is a developer preview, pre-alpha, and **not ready for production use**.  For a stable version of LogicNG use the
version at  [https://github.com/logic-ng/LogicNG](https://github.com/logic-ng/LogicNG).  For a use case of LogicNG 3 you
can look at our [BooleRules](https://github.com/booleworks/boolerules) project.
